# Udacity Project Machine Learning - Enron Mail Dataset

## Introduction
The goal of the project is to study a dataset of emails of a company called Enron. This company went bankrupt after a the fraud was detected.

"Enron's complex financial statements were confusing to shareholders and analysts. In addition, its complex business model and unethical practices required that the company use accounting limitations to misrepresent earnings and modify the balance sheet to indicate favorable performance." source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal

The information if a person is POI or not is provided by Udacity.

### Project goal
The goals of the project are:
- Get familar with dataset, clean dataset, check dataset for outliers
- Visualize dependencies of features
- Create new features (feature engineering)
- Set up ML model to indentify if a person was a "POI" or not
- Select best features to achieve a good presicion and recall score
- Tune selected model
- Validate model against test data

### Script overview
Documentation: 
1. Jupyter Notebook file "poi_id.ipynb" at the sub-folder "final_project"
2. html file "poi_id.html" (copy of jupyter notebook) in the main directory
3. PDF file "poi_id_v2.pdf" (copy of jupyter notebook) in the main directory
4. The script "poi_id.py" (extract from the jupyter file) and the created .pkl files are located at the sub-folder "final_project". The project evaluator will test these using the tester.py script.
